# Characters
**Tortoise:** tries to prove that a race-course can have an infinite number of distances ^b34ea6

**Achilles:** takes notes on the Tortoise’s argument ^338919

# Plot
After a race, the Tortoise ([[#^b34ea6]]) mentions to Achilles ([[#^338919]]) how Achilles got to the end of the race-course that’s a series of infinite distances even though he thought someone proved that it couldn’t be done. The Tortoise gives the following example of a real race-course that can’t be finished:
- (A) Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other
- (B) The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same
- (Z) The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other


If someone doesn’t believe Z, it’s because they’re not accepting the following:
- (C) If A and B are true, Z must be true


If they don’t accept Z given A, B, and C, then they need a D, etc.

# What’s the point?

Here’s what I got out of it: it’s illogical to take logic too literally. You can get lost in logic if you don’t periodically check in with reality to make sure you’re still on track.
