<h1>Characters</h1>
<p><strong>Tortoise:</strong> tries to prove that a race-course can have an infinite number of distances 
<p><strong>Achilles:</strong> takes notes on the Tortoise’s argument 
<h1>Plot</h1>
<p>After a race, the Tortoise  mentions to Achilles  how Achilles got to the end of the race-course that’s a series of infinite distances even though he thought someone proved that it couldn’t be done. The Tortoise gives the following example of a real race-course that can’t be finished:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other</li>
<li>(B) The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same</li>
<li>(Z) The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone doesn’t believe Z, it’s because they’re not accepting the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(C) If A and B are true, Z must be true</li>
</ul>
<p>If they don’t accept Z given A, B, and C, then they need a D, etc.</p>
<h1>What’s the point?</h1>
<p>Here’s what I got out of it: it’s illogical to take logic too literally. You can get lost in logic if you don’t periodically check in with reality to make sure you’re still on track.</p>
